# Why? 
SOMEONE'S GOTTA LEARN AND ACTUALLY BE A LEARNED MAN?ðŸ«¡ðŸ¤¯

I would like to focus on understanding if Medicare claims actually lack the ability to have direct measures of function and physical disability. For example, can we not understand disability and fraility with medicare datasets? 

Would not seeing a specific pattern of hospitalization, mobility assistance and types of prescriptions be an indicator or needing more assistance?
## Questions I would like to answer
1. Is medicare claims a good measure of frality and fitness of the patients?
	- If so, how do we validate these results?
2. More to come once I read these research papers cause I'm lacking familiarity in this department
	- I don't plan on studying long term cost and its correlation to price. I feel like it's pretty obvious to some extent while also being tiring considering retirement and disability benefits looking of scary.
# Predicted technology? 
- Python cause my head is going to explode splitting learning times with R 
- Maybe java for specific stream processing like Apache flinks
	- Ideally used to pipe stuff to a superset cluster or tableau public
- Jupyter notebook/lab
